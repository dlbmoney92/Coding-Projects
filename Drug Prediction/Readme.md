Drug Prediction Project
Overview
The Drug Prediction Project aims to predict the type of drug that a patient is likely to be prescribed based on their medical characteristics, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical features. The goal of this project is to classify patients into one of several drug categories, helping healthcare professionals make more accurate predictions for drug prescriptions.

Technologies Used
Python for implementing the project
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Key Algorithms
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Results
The project implements several classification algorithms, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance. The best model achieved an accuracy of 88%, demonstrating that machine learning models can successfully predict the appropriate drug based on patient data.

The Random Forest model outperformed other algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and SVM, in terms of both accuracy and precision, making it the best choice for drug prediction in this dataset.

Steps Taken
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model Building: Various machine learning models were trained on the data to predict drug categories.
Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to determine the best performing algorithm.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict drug prescriptions based on patient characteristics, helping healthcare providers make informed decisions.
