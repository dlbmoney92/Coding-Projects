# SQL Chicago Project

## Overview
The **SQL Chicago Project** focuses on analyzing housing data in Chicago using SQL. The project utilizes a large dataset containing various housing attributes such as location, price, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal of the project is to perform detailed data analysis and explore relationships between housing prices and different factors. The project demonstrates how SQL queries can be used to clean, aggregate, and analyze data effectively to generate actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** for querying and data manipulation
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage and management
- **SQLite** (optional, depending on setup) for local querying and testing
- **Python** (optional, for additional analysis)

## Results
Through the project, several key insights were gathered from the data, such as:
- The **average price** of homes in Chicago is significantly influenced by factors like **location**, **square footage**, and **neighborhood**.
- **Listings in downtown Chicago** tend to have a higher price compared to homes in suburban areas.
- The analysis found that **properties with more bedrooms** and **larger square footage** typically have higher sale prices.
- **SQL queries** like `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` were used to explore relationships between features and determine patterns in the data.
- **Key findings** include the identification of **high-demand neighborhoods** and the ability to forecast **price trends** based on certain property features.
