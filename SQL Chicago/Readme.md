## Steps in the Project
1. **Database Setup**:
   - Load datasets into a relational database.
   - Normalize tables for efficient querying.

2. **SQL Queries**:
   - Analyze crime rates across neighborhoods and identify common offenses.
   - Explore business activity trends and identify economic growth areas.
   - Evaluate the distribution of public services and their correlation with crime rates.

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Join datasets to uncover relationships (e.g., crime vs. public services).
   - Aggregate data for neighborhood-level and city-level analysis.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Export query results to Python.
   - Create bar charts, heatmaps, and trend lines to visualize findings.

## Results
### Crime Analysis
- Certain neighborhoods have consistently higher crime rates.
- Theft and assault are the most commonly reported offenses.

### Public Services
- Disparities exist in the allocation of schools and libraries.
- Neighborhoods with better access to public services tend to have lower crime rates.

### Business Activity
- High business density correlates with economic growth but also higher crime rates.
- Most new businesses are concentrated in the downtown area, highlighting economic inequality.

## Key Insights
1. Public service allocation significantly impacts crime reduction.
2. Economic activity is heavily concentrated in specific areas, leaving other neighborhoods underdeveloped.
3. Targeted interventions in high-crime areas can improve safety and attract economic opportunities.
