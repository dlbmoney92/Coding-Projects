Using a dataset of patients experiencing heart disease, this project involved thorough analysis of the dataset, including processing and cleaning. Subsequently, various models were trained and predictions were made using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network. The goal of this project was to utilize the dataset to train models aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of recorded health parameters, including age, sex, chest pain, and more.
