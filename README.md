## Projects
1. [Drug Prediction](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Drug_Prediction_project.ipynb)
   - **Description:** The Drug Prediction Project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the type of drug suitable for patients based on various health parameters. Using a dataset containing information such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, this project aims to develop models that classify patients into different drug categories. The project involves comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, and the application of multiple classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Logistic Regression.
   - **Results:** The project successfully trained and evaluated multiple classification models to predict drug types based on health-related features.
2. [Heart Disease Model](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Heart_Disease_Model.ipynb)
   -  **Description:** The project predicts the quality of the wine in the value 0 or 1. 1 for good quality and 0 for bad quality
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and knn
   - **Results:** The logistic regression model performs the best with accuracy of 86.67%
3. [House Sales_in_King_Count_USA](https://github.com/SUKHMAN-SINGH-1612/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Heart%20Stroke%20Prediction)
   -  **Description:** The project predicts the risk of heart stroke on studying the person's demographics and medical info
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and knn
   - **Results:** The logistic regression, SVM and KNN performs the best with 93.8 % accuracy
