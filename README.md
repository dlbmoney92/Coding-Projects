## Projects
1. [Drug Prediction](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Drug_Prediction_project.ipynb)
   - **Description:** The Drug Prediction Project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the type of drug suitable for patients based on various health parameters. Using a dataset containing information such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, this project aims to develop models that classify patients into different drug categories. The project involves comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, and the application of multiple classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Logistic Regression.
   - **Results:** The project successfully trained and evaluated multiple classification models to predict drug types based on health-related features.
2. [Heart Disease Model](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Heart_Disease_Model.ipynb)
   -  **Description:** This project predicts the quality of wine, classifying it as either 0 (bad quality) or 1 (good quality). The model helps assess wine quality using various features like acidity, alcohol content, and pH levels, utilizing machine learning classification techniques.
   - **Technologies Used:** This project leverages various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on input features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The analysis is performed using Python, with libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
   - **Results:** Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score, making it the most reliable model for predicting heart disease in this analysis
3. [House Sales in King County](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/Coding-Projects/tree/main/House%20Sale)
   -  **Description:** This project analyzes house sales data in King County, Washington, to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, location, and number of rooms.
   - **Technologies Used:** The project uses machine learning techniques like Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Decision Trees. It is implemented using Python, with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, model training, and visualization.
   - **Results:** The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with an R^2 score of 0.92, providing highly accurate predictions for house prices based on the input features.
4. [Space X Landing Model](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/SpaceX-Capstone)
   -  **Description:** This project predicts the successful landing of SpaceX rockets based on various features like flight number, payload mass, launch site, and more. The task is framed as a binary classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a rocket will land successfully (1) or fail (0).
   - **Technologies Used:** The project utilizes machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. It is implemented in Python, using libraries like Scikit-learn for model development, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.
   - **Results:** The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 90.5%, making it the most reliable model for predicting rocket landings. Gradient Boosting also performed well with an accuracy of 89.7%, confirming the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting rocket landing success.
5. [SQL Chicago Housing](https://github.com/dlbmoney92/Coding-Projects/tree/main/SQL%20Chicago)
   -  **Description:** This project analyzes the Chicago Housing dataset using SQL to extract, clean, and analyze housing data. The goal is to identify trends in housing prices based on factors like location, square footage, and amenities. Various SQL queries are written to explore relationships between different features and housing prices.
   - **Technologies Used:** The project uses SQL for data querying and manipulation, with advanced techniques like joins, group by, subqueries, and aggregate functions. It leverages SQLite and PostgreSQL for data storage and querying.
   - **Results:** The analysis identifies key factors influencing housing prices, such as location, square footage, and the number of bedrooms. The project highlights that properties with more bedrooms and those located in certain neighborhoods tend to have higher prices. Additionally, proximity to public transportation was found to significantly impact housing values.
