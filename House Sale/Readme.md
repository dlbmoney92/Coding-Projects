# House Sales in King County

## Overview
The **House Sales in King County** project aims to predict house prices in King County, Washington, based on various features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and other property attributes. This project uses machine learning models to analyze historical sales data and predict the future selling prices of homes in the area.

The dataset contains features related to the properties like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and proximity to key landmarks, and is used to train models for regression analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for project implementation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis

## Key Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**

## Results
After training and evaluating different regression models, the **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest performance, providing a good fit for predicting house prices in King County.

### Model Performance
- **Linear Regression**: Achieved an R² score of **0.85**, which indicated a good fit for the linear model.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Achieved the best performance with an R² score of **0.92**, making it the most accurate model for predicting house prices in this dataset.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Achieved an R² score of **0.87**, which was decent but lower than the Random Forest model.

These results confirm that the **Random Forest Regressor** is the best model for predicting house prices based on the available features in the dataset.
