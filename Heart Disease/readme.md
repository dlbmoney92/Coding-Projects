# Heart Disease Model

## Overview
The **Heart Disease Model** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical features. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators. The goal is to classify the data into two categories: 1 for patients with heart disease and 0 for those without.

This project utilizes multiple classification algorithms to predict heart disease and assess which model performs best in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for implementation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## Key Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Results
After training and evaluating several machine learning models, the **Logistic Regression** model was found to be the best-performing algorithm, with an accuracy of **86.67%**. This model was able to effectively classify patients with heart disease and achieve the highest precision and recall among the models tested.

Here are the results from the evaluation:

- **Logistic Regression**: 86.67% accuracy, best overall performance
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: 83.12% accuracy
- **Decision Tree**: 79.45% accuracy
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 81.23% accuracy

The **Logistic Regression** model performed significantly better than the others, making it the most reliable choice for predicting heart disease based on the features available in the dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting heart disease risk, providing valuable insights that could aid in early detection and treatment planning. The **Logistic Regression** model achieved the highest accuracy and proved to be a robust solution for this classification task.
